# Mr. Rogers

Mr Rogers is known for Mr Rogers' Neighborhood. If you are not familiar with
his work... I recommend that you spend (at least) a few minutes reading about
him.

I recently cam across an article titled
[How to Talk to Kids, According to Mister Rogers by Willa Matthews](https://www.fatherly.com/life/how-to-talk-to-kids-mister-rogers). The article references Mr Rogers' innate ability to speak to children and summarizes an excerpt from Maxwell King’s *The Good Neighbor: The Life and Work of Fred Rogers*...

>  1. “State the idea you wish to express as clearly as possible, and in terms
>     preschoolers can understand.” Example: It is dangerous to play in the
>     street.
>
>  2. “Rephrase in a positive manner,” as in It is good to play where it is
>     safe.
>  
>  3. “Rephrase the idea, bearing in mind that preschoolers cannot yet make
>     subtle distinctions and need to be redirected to authorities they trust.”
>      As in, “Ask your parents where it is safe to play.”
>  
>  4. “Rephrase your idea to eliminate all elements that could be considered
>     prescriptive, directive, or instructive.” In the example, that’d mean
>    getting rid of “ask”: Your parents will tell you where it is safe to play.
>  
>  5. “Rephrase any element that suggests certainty.” That’d be “will”: Your
>     parents can tell you where it is safe to play.
>  
>  6. “Rephrase your idea to eliminate any element that may not apply to all
>     children.” Not all children know their parents, so: Your favorite
>    grown-ups can tell you where it is safe to play.
>  
>  7. “Add a simple motivational idea that gives preschoolers a reason to follow
>     your advice.” Perhaps: Your favorite grown-ups can tell you where it is
>    safe to play. It is good to listen to them.
>  
>  8. “Rephrase your new statement, repeating the first step.” “Good” represents
>     a value judgment, so: Your favorite grown-ups can tell you where it is
>    safe to play. It is important to try to listen to them.
>  
>  9. “Rephrase your idea a final time, relating it to some phase of development
>     a preschooler can understand.” Maybe: Your favorite grown-ups can tell you
>    where it is safe to play. It is important to try to listen to them, and
>    listening is an important part of growing.
